# 🚗 Car Sales Data Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis of a car sales dataset using **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI**. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from used car data to understand pricing trends, car features, and customer preferences.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)** – For data cleaning and initial visualizations
- **MySQL** – For querying, aggregating, and filtering structured data
- **Power BI** – For building an interactive and professional dashboard
- **CSV Dataset** – Real-world used car listings (from `Car dekho.csv`)

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Average selling price** trends over time
- Top 5 most expensive cars
- Cars grouped by **fuel type**, **transmission**, and **ownership**
- Price comparisons between **manual vs automatic**, **first vs second owners**
- Majority of cars are Petrol and Manual transmission

## 📊 Dashboard Highlights (Power BI)

- KPI cards: Total Cars, Average Price, Max/Min Price
- Bar charts: Cars by Fuel Type, Owner, Year
- Line graph: Average Price Trend by Year
- Slicers: Filter by Fuel, Transmission, Year, Owner Type
